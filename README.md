# Cyclistic Demand Analysis – Business Intelligence Project

## Project Context
This project is part of the Google Business Intelligence Certificate (Course 1 – Foundations of BI). The objective is to apply structured BI thinking to understand customer demand patterns for a bike-share company operating across New York City.

---

## Business Problem
Cyclistic’s Customer Growth Team needs to understand how customer demand varies across station locations and how this demand has changed over time. Without this clarity, bike allocation decisions risk under-serving high-demand locations and over-allocating resources to low-demand areas.

---

## Core Business Question
How has customer demand at different station locations changed over time, and how should Cyclistic prioritize bike availability to support growth?
